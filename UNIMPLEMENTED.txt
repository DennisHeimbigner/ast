The following items are currently unimplemented vis-a-vis
the latest protobuf standard (something that does not really
exist).
Items are ordered in approximate priority: highest to lowest

* Custom options can have aggregate types. For example,
      message MyOption {
        optional string comment = 1;
        optional string author = 2;
      }
      extend google.protobuf.FieldOptions {
        optional MyOption myoption = 12345;
      }
    This option can now be set as follows:
      message SomeType {
        optional int32 field = 1 [(myoption) = { comment:'x' author:'y' }];
      }

* Transfer .proto comments to generated code

* Add Import Public

* Add allow_alias





inf, -inf, and nan can now be used as default values for float and double
    fields.
